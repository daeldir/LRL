LRL Recursive License
=====================

What is it?
-----------

The **LRL Recursive License** is a reaction to the
[WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) license. As we have had a lot of
flamewars about the GPL vs BSD licenses, of which neither are really
free, I decided to take a look to the WTFPL license. And there, horror!
The WTFPL is not free either!

Indeed, that part of the text: 

> changing it is allowed as long as the name is changed.

Is an outrageous affront to our freedom!

To clarify, that bit of text apply to the license, not the work that the
license protect. And there is a great truth about all of our "free"
licenses: a lot of them **don't** let us change their text. If the work
is free, the license is proprietary.

Hence, I come again with that old joke of a recursive acronym, and take
it one, two step furthers. The work is protected by the license, and so
is the license.

What does it look like?
-----------------------

Here is the smallest expression of the license I could come with:

> ### LRL Recursive License

> _Copyright Tartempion <tartempion@example.net> Â© 1850_

> Permission is granted  to  use,  copy,  modify and/or distribute this
> work as long as:

>  * You follow the license

> This license is under LRL Recursive license.

That is, you can do whatever you want with the work that this license
protect (that can be code, music, picture...). Following the terms of
the license is automatic, and you shouldn't be able to **not** follow
the license. Also, the last line enable you to modify the license
itself, adding conditions as you wish.

When talking about software, the license usually comes with a
non-responsability clause. Here is my try at it:

> **This software is provided with the guarantee that it will fail some
> day. Use it at your own risk.**

That is, we all know a software is meant to fail (and that's why we have
this kind of clause). And it's really easy to make it fail. If my code
becomes obviously perfect (or not obviously fallible), I may change this
clause (I doubt i will ever do that for that kind of reason).

Is it really free?
------------------

Well, yes, that version of the LRL is free. However, **always** read the
text of a LRL license. Because the LRL text can be modified whithout
condition, it can be made non-free by adding clauses.

What are the conditions for my license to be called LRL?
--------------------------------------------------------

Well, none, because you can do anything with it...

Okay, I'll give you some advice:

If you do not want to look like an idiot, or worse _(an as\*\*le)_), you
should be careful to stay in the _spirit_ of the license. That is, it
should be free, automatic, and recursive.

This is an example of good LRL license:

> Permission  is  granted  to use, copy,  modify  and/or distribute
> this work and/or license, under the following conditions:
>
> 1. You respect the second point.
> 2. You respect the first and third points.
> 3. And by the way, respecting the fifth point is fine too.
> 4. You follow this license.

This is an example of slightly bad LRL license:

> Permission is granted to copy, modify and/or distribute this work
> and/or license, without conditions.

That license is as free as the LRL, but it lack some tautology.

Here is an example of moderately bad license:

> Permission  is  granted  to use, copy,  modify  and/or distribute
> this work, under the following conditions:
>
> 1. Any derivative work of this one must be distributed under the same
>    license.

It is not tautological at all. It take away one of your freedoms,
although the license remain open source. And the license is not applied
to itself. Seriously, why would you call it LRL? And dumb people would
think they have more right than what you give (as LRL is basically a
public domain license). That last point is not the worse, anyway,
because anybody familiar enough with the LRL to **not** read it's text
**will** read it's text.

And finally, an example of really bad LRL license:

> I don't want you to use this work, go fuck yourself!

Also known as TPSL, _Traditionnal Proprietary Software License_, that
license is vulgar. If you want vulgarity, use the WTFPL. Also, this
license is not recursive (but with basic copyright, that's not an issue
in regard of the terms of that license). And, what's worse than
anything, that license does not grant you any right, any freedom.

So, you can call your license a LRL license, but the farest you go of
the spirit of the license, the more you will be in disgrace in the eyes
of those _who know_.

I advise, if you write your own license, that it should be more free
than the WTFPL, and have some bits of humor in it.

Why is this license in a VCS?
-----------------------------

_(In case you don't know, VCS stands for Version Control System. In
our case, it's git.)_

Well, the LRL is really free and can evolve. I hope to keep in that
repository different versions of the LRL, in different languages, why
not, and in different terms. I will only accept licenses that I judge
worthy of the LRL's spirit.

I may also keep some documentation in this repository about debates
around the LRL (it's usage, it's validity, the gotchas...)

If you read french, you can take a look at the first discussions about
the LRL
